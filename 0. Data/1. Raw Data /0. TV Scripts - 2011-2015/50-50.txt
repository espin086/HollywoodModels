Shooting Script

EXT. SEATTLE - DAY
It’s an unusually clear winter day as the peaks of Mount
Rainier look down on the avenues and harbors of Seattle.
ADAM LERNER (27) jogs through the streets of Seattle. The
morning mist envelops the PIER. Adam’s iPod blares in his ear
as he passes the FISH MARKET.
Adam arrives at a street corner. Ahead, a “Don’t Walk” sign
blinks. So he does. Running in place, Adam looks from side to
side. There’s not a car, person or thing in sight this early
in the morning. He looks again at the orange hand, urging him
to stop.
Another JOGGER runs up behind Adam, and disobeys the
crosswalk, running past him and across the street. Adam
continues to wait for the light to change.
The light goes green. He crosses.
INT. SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER
Adam tries to squirt shampoo into his hand, but the bottle is
empty. He looks over at a large assortment of women’s
products, grabs the first one - Fructis by L’Oreal - and
squirts some into his hair. He proceeds to lather his entire
body in the product.
INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Adam dresses in front of the mirror. His outfit is well puttogether. He pulls out a LINT BRUSH and meticulously combs
his cardigan. RACHAEL (24), wearing her oversized “KEEP TAHOE
BLUE” shirt, enters the bedroom brushing her teeth.
ADAM
So are you staying over tonight?
RACHAEL
Uh...Not sure. There are a couple
of gallery openings I want to check
out.
Rachael goes through Adam’s drawers looking for something.
RACHAEL (CONT’D)
I’m so nervous about my show. I
still have so much work to do.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

RACHAEL (CONT’D)
I need two more paintings and
everything I’ve been coming up with
is completely derivative of what
I’ve been seeing at the Henry.
(confused)
Where’s my stuff?
ADAM
It’s in your drawer.
RACHAEL
(honored)
I have a drawer?
ADAM
(sheepish)
Yeah, I just figured I’d put some
of your things... there wasn’t
anything in the drawer. Well there
were a few things, but I just moved
them to a different one because...
It made sense that way.
RACHAEL
(touched)
Awwwww. Honey. We’re getting so
domestic.

SFX: A CAR HORN.
EXT. ADAM’S HOUSE - SAME TIME
Kyle sits in his car front of Adam’s house, his seat
reclined, his eyes squeezed shut, hungover. He honks the horn
again, winces at the noise.
INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME
Adam rushes to gather his things.
ADAM (CONT’D)
Good luck with the paintings.
He moves to her, leans in - despite her mouth full of
toothpaste.
RACHAEL
Oops, I’ve got toothpaste in my
mouth.
She wipes it off his nose. He gives her a small kiss.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
RACHAEL (CONT’D)
Have a good day.

Bye.

ADAM
(big smile)

INT. KYLE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Adam gets into the car.
Yo!

KYLE

ADAM
Sorry I’m late.
Kyle sniffs the air.
KYLE
...What’s that smell?
(Sniffs Adam)
Did you sit in jam or something?
ADAM
What are you talking about?
KYLE
You smell all fruity.
No.

ADAM

(smells himself)
I ran out of shampoo. I had to use
Rachael’s.
KYLE
Well, you smell like you fucked the
cast of “The View”.
Adam looks at his watch.
ADAM
Are we gonna go? We’re gonna be
late.
KYLE
If you really care about being on
time, you should probably learn how
to drive.
ADAM
I deserve that.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KYLE
You know what’s really going to
make us late? When I stop for
cappuccinos.
ADAM
No, no, no. We have coffee at work.
KYLE
Delicious cappuccinos.
Kyle drives off.
INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER
Adam and Kyle stand in line. Kyle watches as Adam yawns
repeatedly. He looks exhausted.
KYLE
Back still hurts?
ADAM
Yeah, I’m going to see the doctor
today.
KYLE
Have you been fucking in weird
positions?
ADAM
Of course that’s where you have to
go with it.
KYLE
Sometimes it happens when I try new
positions - like I tried froggy
style for a while; fucked up my
back.
ADAM
“Froggy style”? I don’t even want
to ask what that is.
KYLE
It’s kind of like doggy style but
you get way higher up.
ADAM
(beat)
We haven’t done it in three weeks.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KYLE
(shocked)
You haven’t had sex in three
weeks!?
ADAM
Well, she had a yeast infection,
and then she had her period.
KYLE
You can fuck on a yeast infection.
ADAM
No, it hurts.
It does?

KYLE

ADAM
Well, that’s what she says.
KYLE
I think that’s bullshit.
ADAM
No, I’ve heard that before.
KYLE
Has she been sucking on your dick,
giving you blow jobs?
ADAM
No, she doesn’t like to.
KYLE
(a little upset)
No fucking shit she doesn’t like
to! Who likes putting dicks in
their mouths? That’s why they call
them jobs!
ADAM
Don’t get hysterical, it’s not that
big a deal.
KYLE
I’m not hysterical. She stays at
your house all the time. She leaves
her fucking shit everywhere. You
clean it up. You’re a nice person.
The least she can do is felate you.

EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Kyle and Adam walk down the sidewalk. Adam’s a few steps
ahead, walking at a hurried pace as Kyle takes his time, sips
his coffee.
KYLE
You put up with a lot of shit when
you date a hot girl. Truthfully,
that’s why if you recall in high
school I didn’t date any hot girls.
ADAM
That’s why?
KYLE
Yes. That’s why.
ADAM
Well, we’re not in high school
anymore. The relationship I have
with Rachael is about more than
sex.
KYLE
(condescending)
What is it about, Adam?
ADAM
We care about each other -- talk to
each other.
KYLE
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could do
that and bang the hell out of each
other afterwards?
They walk up the front steps of SEATTLE PUBLIC RADIO.
ADAM
Ideally, yes. But it’s not a
perfect world, OK?...Can you hurry
up please?
Kyle stops and leans over.
KYLE
Ugh...Just got to tie my shoe.
INT. SEATTLE PUBLIC RADIO - DAY
Adam and Kyle enter the offices of Seattle Public Radio. They
pass JENNY at the reception desk. Kyle shoots her a smile.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KYLE
Morning Jenny.
She ignores him. As they continue, Seth looks over at Adam
nervously biting on his finger nails.
KYLE
That’s so gross man. You shouldn’t
do that.
PHIL (40), Adam and Kyle’s boss, passes by.
PHIL
Kyle...Adam.
Hey Phil.

KYLE AND ADAM

ADAM
(worried)
Sorry we’re late.
Phil looks at his watch, not even aware of the time.
PHIL
Huh. Look at that, you are late.
Don’t do that.
ADAM
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about the volcano piece, it’s
coming along really well, I’ve done
all the research and interviewsGreat.

PHIL

ADAM
Yeah but the narration is turning
into a bit of a problem. Whoever
did it, he kept clearing his throat
and he didn’t pause, he just kept
talking - there aren’t any edit
points. If he had just stopped and
cleared his throat I could cut
around it, but he didn’t-Phil’s cell phone rings.
Cool.

PHIL

KYLE
Yeah, grab that.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
Phil pulls out his Blackberry and walks off, ignoring the
conversation.
ADAM
OK. I’m just going to-Adam and Kyle watch Phil walk away. Adam turns to Kyle.
ADAM
It's like he doesn't care.
KYLE
It’s like we got to put shit on the
air. And it’s pointless to spend
months working on something that
someone’s going to hear for two
seconds stopped at a red light.
ADAM
I like it when my work is good.
KYLE
Good luck with that.
INT. ADAM’S CUBICLE - LATER
Adam sits at his desk, head phones on, editing his volcano
story on Pro-Tools. He meticulously edits the same audio
point over and over. He cringes at the deafening sound of
Kyle’s laughter across the office.
KYLE
(into phone)
You’re in Wales? So does that make
you Welsh? Or Wale-ish?
Adam looks at Kyle in annoyance.
KYLE
OK. World Music...Can you hear me?
You sound like a robot...Does it
sound weird to you? It sounds weird
to me...
ADAM
You have to be quieter, I’m-Kyle is oblivious to Adam.
KYLE
I said you sound like a robot...
Wait, wait, wait. Go back.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLE (cont'd)
It’s unbelievable. I know. I don’t
know what ‘World Music’ is either!

Annoyed, Adam imitates Kyle to himself.
ADAM
(as Kyle)
I’m such a fucking asshole. I’m the
king of the world, suck my dick. I
hear Adam hasn’t gotten his dick
sucked in six fucking months.
EXT. PACIFIC GENERAL HOSPITAL - LATER
Adam steps off a BUS and walks toward the hospital’s vast
sunlit entryway. He enters through the sliding double doors,
eventually disappearing into the din of the crowd.
INT. DR. ROSS’ OFFICE - LATER
Adam leafs through a pamphlet on incontinence when the
pedantic DR. ROSS enters.

Hi.

(curt)

DR. ROSS

Dr. Ross looks over Adam’s chart, examines his MRI scans, and
pulls out a DICTAPHONE DR. ROSS
(into the dictaphone)
Patient has been complaining of
back pain, and night sweats. Blood
tests and urine analysis are
normal. MRI suggests a massive
intradural malignant schwannoma
neurofibrosarcoma extending into
psoas muscle with nerve root
compression syndrome and bone
erosion.
We see Adam’s face gradually look more and more confused. He
slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question.
DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
Growth extends from the L2 to L5.
Will send patient for biopsy to
confirm.
Dr. Ross turns to see Adam holding his arm in the air.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Yes?

DR. ROSS (CONT’D)

ADAM
I’m so sorry, I didn’t follow that.
Is there something wrong with me?
DR. ROSS
(points to MRI)
If you look here on your MRI, you
see this cephalopod-like object
spreading down along your spinal
column?
Adam squints. It all looks the same.
DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
That is a massive schwannoma
neurofibrosarcoma.
ADAM
I’m sorry, I still don’t-DR. ROSS
It’s a malignant tumor.
A tumor?
Yes.
Me?
Yes.

ADAM
DR. ROSS
ADAM
DR. ROSS

ADAM
That doesn’t make sense...I don’t
smoke. I don’t drink. I recycle...
DR. ROSS
Well your case it’s actually quite
fascinating. Your cancer is the
result of an incredibly rare gene
mutation in chromosome 17p in the
p53 gene that causes the growth of
malignant cells in tissue around
the nerves. In your case it’s grown
along the nerves in your lower
spine.
Adam walks over to the window and peers out.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
DR. ROSS
People can go years without knowing
they’re sick. We’re lucky we caught
it before it metastasizes. Given
the placement and size of your
particular tumor, the wisest course
of action is to see if we can
possibly reduce this thing down to
a more managable size.
(Beat)
I’m going to put you on a four
month regimen of chemotherapy.
(beat)
Now Chemotherapy can result in
fertility issues-ADAM
But I’m going to be okay?
Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are
seemingly genuine; his tone is anything but.
DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
If you need to talk to someone...
We have an excellent staff of
social workers and psychologists
here in the hospital. They
specialize in cases...in
these...sort of matters. They’ll be
able to help you.
Dr. Ross continues to talk as Adam looks out of the window.
INT. ADAM’S OFFICE - DUSK
CLOSE ON a computer screen:
“Neurofibromasarcoma Schwannoma is a malignant or cancerous
form of Schwanoma.
Treatment Forms: Chemotherapy and Radiation. Surgical
resection proven to be most effective. Risks of surgery:
Amputation of limbs. Paralysis. Death.
It is a rare tumor type, with a relatively poor prognosis.
Patient response to treatment will vary based on age, health,
and the tolerance to medications and therapies.
5 Year survival rate: 50%.
5 year survival rate after metastasis: 0%.”

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
He stares at the screen. This is not good. Everyone else is
leaving for the day, shutting off lights. Adam stays,
immobile and alone.
INT. BUS - NIGHT
Adam sits deep in thought - or in shock - hard to tell. The
dusky pink sky of Seattle streaks by through tinted glass.
INT. ADAM’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Adam and Rachael are on the couch, her eyes filled with
tears.
Oh Adam...

RACHAEL

ADAM
Listen. I don’t expect you to take
this on. It’s not like we’re
married or anything. If you have to
bail, bail.
(off her look)
I hope you won’t--I mean, I want
you with me. But if you have to-She looks at him, into his eyes, closes hers:
RACHAEL
I’m not going to bail on you, Adam.
She leans over, hugs him.
RACHAEL (CONT’D)
I’m here for you.
Thank you.

ADAM

Rachael rubs Adam’s back.
RACHAEL
It’s going to be okay.
Rachael leans in and puts her forehead against Adam’s.
RACHAEL
Everything’s going to be okay.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
Adam and Kyle stand outside the coffee shop. Kyle looks sick.
KYLE
I’m going to throw up.
ADAM
Don’t throw up -- you’ll be fine.
KYLE
I actually think I’m going to throw
up.
ADAM
You’re not going to throw up.
KYLE
I’m going to throw up.
ADAM
Just open your eyes...Look at me.
Alright?
They both take a deep breath.
KYLE
What kind of cancer is it?
ADAM
It’s something rare.
KYLE
Well, what’s it called?
ADAM
Schwanoma something...
KYLE
(confused)
Schwanoma?...What’s Schwanoma?
ADAM
That means tumor basically.
KYLE
Do you have a picture of it, can I
see it?
ADAM
Why would I have a picture of it?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KYLE
It’s common practice to fucking get
pictures of shit now!
ADAM
It doesn’t look like anything, it’s
just a lump.
KYLE
Well are you going to be okay? What
are your odds?
ADAM
I don’t know, I looked it up and it
said 50/50, but that’s the internet
so...
Kyle sighs in relief.
KYLE
(upbeat)
That’s not that bad. That’s better
than I thought. You’re going to be
fine. You’re young...People beat
cancer all the time. Every
celebrity beats cancer. Lance
Armstrong, he keeps getting it.
Yeah.

ADAM

KYLE
The guy from “Dexter”? He’s OK.
Patrick Swayze; he’s fine.
ADAM
Patrick Swayze?
KYLE
And he’s older.
ADAM
But dude, that guy’s dead.
Kyle looks at Adam in shock.
Really?
Yeah.

KYLE
ADAM

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
KYLE
That’s really fucked up. I didn’t
know that.
(beat)
Don’t even think about him...Don’t
worry about that. You got to look
at the bright side here-ADAM
The bright side of what?
KYLE
You’ll be fine.
Kyle quickly tries to change the subject.
KYLE
What did your parents say? Did they
freak out?
ADAM
Oh, I...they...I’m not going to
tell them.
KYLE
You’re not going to tell them?
You’ve got to tell them. Your
mom’ll probably deal with it better
than most people...Your dad has
Alzheimer's.
ADAM
Yeah, but you know how she gets.
KYLE
You have to tell her.
ADAM
(concedes)
I know. I’ll tell her.
Kyle takes another deep breath.
KYLE
You’ll be fine. 50/50! If you were
a casino game you’d have the best
odds!
Kyle pats Adam’s shoulder.
ADAM
Yeah. Thanks.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)
Good talk.

KYLE

Kyle begins walking away from the coffee shop.
ADAM
You don’t want coffee?
KYLE
I’m awake now.
EXT. ADAM’S HOUSE - DAY
Adam’s mother, DIANE LERNER (58), steps out of her car and
onto the curb where she’s greeted by her son.
Hi Mom.
Hi Honey!

ADAM
DIANE

She gives Adam a big hug and kiss. Based on his body
language, it’s clear Diane’s very existence annoys the shit
out of Adam.
RICHARD LERNER (60) wanders out from behind Diane. On first
glance he seems like a perfectly normal middle aged man, but
on closer examination it’s clear that Alzheimer's has altered
his sense of reality. He extends his hand to Adam.
Hi Dad.

ADAM

RICHARD
Hi, I’m Richard.
DIANE
(to Richard)
This is Adam -- your son. Remember?
Adam shakes his dad’s hand and gives him an awkward pat on
the shoulder. It’s clear Richard makes Adam uncomfortable.
Adam...

RICHARD

Meanwhile, Rachael stands on the porch, awkward smile
plastered on her face.

Hi!

RACHAEL
(from porch)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Diane politely nods and waves in her direction as she and
Adam walk toward the house.
DIANE
So what’s the big news?
ADAM
It’s nothing...I’ll tell you
inside.
DIANE (CONT’D)
She’s not pregnant?
Adam stops, turns and looks at his mother.
Mom!

ADAM

DIANE
I know, I know, you use protection.
Adam cringes, totally mortified. He stares at her for a beat
then turns and walks into the house, shaking his head.
As Diane follows behind she notices the paint on Adam’s porch
is chipping.
DIANE (CONT’D)
You need to talk to your landlord
about painting this.
It’s fine.

ADAM

Adam rolls his eyes and walks:
INSIDE
Diane follows after him.
DIANE (CONT’D)
Just give me his number and I’ll
call him.
Diane notices an ABSTRACT PAINTING hanging on the wall above
the TV.
DIANE
That’s new.
ADAM
Rachael made it for me...It’s
called “Oppression”.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
Rachael leans over and corrects him.
RACHAEL
“Liberation”.
ADAM
That’s right! That one’s
“Liberation”. “Oppression” is in
the bathroom.
Diane feigns a smile, trying to seem impressed.
Nice.
Thank you.

DIANE
RACHAEL

INT. ADAM’S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - EVENING
Adam, Rachael, Diane, and Richard sit at the dinner table,
eating pizza. Diane hands Richard a fistfull of pills.
Richard takes the pills, puts them in his mouth and swallows.
He smiles...Diane scans the house.
DIANE
So, what’s the special occasion?
Adam hesitates.
ADAM
I need to tell you something. But,
before I do, you have to promise me
you’re going to stay calm.
DIANE
Oh Adam, don’t be so overdramatic.
ADAM
Mom, just promise me. Okay?
DIANE
I promise...You make me out to be
some kind of irrational loon.
ADAM
Have you ever seen “Terms of
Endearment”?
RACHAEL
Oh, Jesus, Adam...Just tell her.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
DIANE
Tell me what?
Here goes nothing.
ADAM
(mumbles)
I have cancer.
DIANE
What do you mean, “I have cancer”?
ADAM
I have cancer. What do you want me
to say?
DIANE
When did this happen?
ADAM
(reluctant)
I found out a few days ago.
DIANE
A few days ago?! You waited a few
days to tell me?!
I’m sorry.
Honey.

ADAM
DIANE

Adam nods. Diane’s face literally crumples. She tries to
compose herself.
DIANE
(beat)
I’m moving in.
ADAM
What? No. Absolutely not.
DIANE
I’m your mother Adam.
ADAM
You already have enough on your
plate with dad.
DIANE
Who’s going to take care of you?
You can't even drive! Who's going
to take you to your appointments?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
Adam looks over at Rachel, who notices.
RACHAEL
(hesitates)
Me. I will. I’m going to take care
of him.
Diane sits motionless for what seems like an eternity. The
only indication that she’s not dead is the movement of her
index finger, which twitches uncontrollably. Adam sits
uneasy, trying to anticipate his mother’s next move.
Mom?

ADAM (CONT'D)

Diane calmly rises from her seat and heads to the:
KITCHEN
Adam follows after her:
ADAM (CONT'D)
Mom, what are you doing?
Diane lights the stove, puts up a kettle:
DIANE
I’m making you green tea.
ADAM
Please, will you come sit down?
Diane holds up the package of Green Tea.
DIANE
I saw on “The Today Show” that it
reduces your risk of getting cancer
by fifteen percent.
ADAM
Well -- I already have cancer.
Adam puts his arm on his mother’s shoulder.
ADAM
Please come back to the table.
Diane hugs him and begins to weep.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Adam walks down the corridor and stops at a reception desk.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ADAM
I’m looking for Dr. McKay?
THE ATTENDANT silently points to an office a few doors down.
INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
The office is a pit of chaos; small with stacks of psychology
books and files strewn about. An attractive young woman,
KATHERINE (24), sits on the couch reading a file while she
eats a rather messy sandwich. She, like her office, is
scattered in appearance. She takes a bite of her sandwich as
Adam pokes his head in the door. She looks upKATHERINE
(mouth full of food)
Can I help you?
ADAM
I have an appointment with Dr.
McKay.
KATHERINE
Oh... please come in...
Katherine removes her files from the couch, while awkwardly
balancing her sandwich on top. She rises and puts her hand
out to shake Adam’s - he reluctantly shakes it.
KATHERINE
...and please, call me Katherine.
ADAM
(confused)
You’re Dr. McKay?
KATHERINE
I am. Have a sit.
(corrects herself)
Sit down please.
Katherine wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away. Adam
looks her up and down.
ADAM
Aren’t you supposed to be like
sixty-five and wear earth-toned
sweaters?
KATHERINE
(slightly defensive)
Why? Did someone say that’s what I
look like?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ADAM
No. But, if you don’t mind...How
old are you?
KATHERINE
(put off)
Twenty-four.
ADAM
Twenty-four? What are you like
Doogie Howser?
Who?

KATHERINE

ADAM
Doogie Howser...
Off Katherine’s blank look.
ADAM (CONT’D)
...The teenage doctor.
KATHERINE
Does he work here?
ADAM
No. Nevermind...but aren’t you too
young to be a doctor?
KATHERINE
(almost laughing)
Oh, technically I’m not a doctor
yet. I wish. I’m actually working
on my doctorate.
(off Adam’s look, trying
to be serious)
This is a training hospital.
ADAM
I see...So have you had many
patients?
KATHERINE
My patient history is not-ADAM
(shocked)
I’m your first patient, aren’t I?
KATHERINE
No. Not at all.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
ADAM
Your second?

Third.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Katie looks at him in silent acceptance. Adam’s eyes widen
with concern:
ADAM (CONT'D)
How are the first two doing?
Katherine doesn’t answer. She bites her tongue.
KATHERINE
Can’t talk about that.
ADAM
And this is like part of your
training?
KATHERINE
It’ll be part of my dissertation.
But, don’t worry I’m not gonna use
your real name.
ADAM
(uncomfortable)
Okay. I guess that’s fine.
An awkward beat. Katherine pulls Adam’s file:
KATHERINE
So, Dr. Ross filled me in on your
situation. This must be incredibly
difficult.
Adam shrugs.
KATHERINE (CONT'D)
How are you feeling?
ADAM
You know, honestly, I feel fine.
I’ve actually never been more calm.
KATHERINE
(proud of herself)
That’s a very common symptom found
in patients like yourself. Right
now your body is in survival mode.
What you’re actually experiencing
is shock...
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)
ADAM
No, I think I’m fine.
KATHERINE
...That’s why you feel that sense
of calm. Would you describe what
you’re feeling as a kind of
“numbness”?
ADAM
I would describe it as fine.
KATHERINE
Because certain patients-ADAM
(defiant)
I feel great.
Katherine bites her tongue.
KATHERINE
Wonderful, I think that’s wonderful
-- if it’s alright with you, today
I’d like to start with some very
simple relaxation exercises.
Adam nods, tense.
ADAM
But I am relaxed.
KATHERINE
I know you are. But if you want to
lie down...
Lie down?
Yeah.

ADAM
KATHERINE

Adam clearly doesn’t trust her, but lies down. Katherine
presses play on her laptop - playing new agey meditation
music.
KATHERINE
And close your eyes.
Really?

ADAM

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (4)
KATHERINE
Yeah, for this to work, you’re
gonna have to trust me.
Adam closes his eyes.
ADAM
They’re closed.
OK.

KATHERINE
MATCH CUT TO:

RACHAEL (O.S.)
No peeking...Keep your eyes closed.
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Adam is in the living room with his eyes closed.
RACHAEL
OK. Open your eyes.
Adam opens his eyes to see Rachael standing next to a very
old and giant GREYHOUND. The dog stands motionless.
Surprise!

RACHAEL (CONT’D)

Adam’s excitement quickly dissipates.
RACHAEL
His name is Skeletor. He’s a
retired race dog.
ADAM
You got me an old dog?
RACHAEL
He’s not that old.
ADAM
Well, he’s old enough to be
retired.
The dog continues to stand motionless.
RACHAEL
Having a dog helps with the healing
process.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ADAM
Why, does he have a medical
license?
RACHAEL
Forget it. I can bring him back to
the shelter in the morning.
ADAM
Well what’s going to happen to him?
RACHAEL
He'll be put back in his tiny cage
with ten other dogs who will bully,
and rape him, until he’s eventually
euthanized.
Beat.
ADAM
Fine, I’ll keep the dog.
Really?

RACHAEL

Rachael's face lights up.
RACHAEL
This is going to be so good for
you, I promise.
Adam grumbles to himself.
INT. SEATTLE PUBLIC RADIO - NIGHT
It’s Adam’s going away party. Draped across the entrance is a
“Bon Voyage” banner with an image of a Cruise Ship.
Jenny stands to the side crying as Kyle consoles her.
KYLE
This whole party was my idea.
Thought maybe we could just
celebrate his life.
JENNY
He’s going to get better, right?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KYLE
I hope so. But, tonight I thought
it’d be best if we didn’t think
about whether he gets better or
not. We should be celebrating the
Adam we all know and love.
Kyle steals a quick glimpse of Jenny’s cleavage.
CUT TO:
Adam stands in the middle of the party with JOE.
JOE
Started chemo yet?
CUT TO:
Adam stands with TED.
TED
So what kind of cancer you got?
CUT TO:
Adam stands with SUSAN.
SUSAN
Want to know the secret to beating
this thing?
CUT TO:
Adam stands with GREG.
GREG
My uncle had what you got...
CUT BACK TO:
Kyle’s with Jenny who’s still crying. After a beat, he rubs
her arm.
KYLE
I liked to be touched when I cry.
CUT TO:
Phil embraces Adam.
PHIL
(sentimental)
I’m gonna miss you so much.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
ADAM
(uncomfortable)
I’m going to miss you too Phil.
Phil leans his head on Adam’s shoulder.
ADAM
Hey, Phil--?
PHIL
Yeah, buddy.
ADAM
I want you to know, I’m still going
to finish that Mount Moha Moha
story.
PHIL
Take as much time as you need...I
can’t wait to hear it.
Phil continues to hold Adam.
INT. RACHAEL’S CAR - DAY
Rachael’s Prius, which is covered in various Save-the-World
type bumper stickers, is parked in front of the hospital.
Adam turns to her.
ADAM
I just wanted to say that you’ve
been really great the past couple
of weeks. Thanks for the ride. And
breakfast.
RACHAEL
Thanks for saying that.
Adam opens the passenger side door, and as he gets out,
Rachael yells after him.
Adam.

RACHAEL

He turns back and sticks his head in the door.
ADAM
You coming?
She shakes her head hesitantly.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
RACHAEL
If it’s cool, I’ll just wait here.
ADAM
It’s going to take four hours.
I know.

RACHAEL

ADAM
You’re gonna sit here for four
hours?
RACHAEL
Honey, I don’t want to mix that
world and this world. It’s like an
energy thing, you know?
ADAM
(confused)
Right.
She gives him a kiss.
Good luck!

RACHAEL

Rachael watches Adam as he walks off into the hospital.
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
A small group of patients, including Adam, sit in the waiting
room.
GEORGE, a tall male nurse of Bahamian descent, calls outGEORGE
Adam Lerner.
Adam stands.
Yep.

ADAM

Adam follows George into the:
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
The doors slowly close as they ride down into the bowel of
the hospital.

INT. CANCER WARD - CONTINUOUS
Walking through the long ominous halls of the hospital
basement, Adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being
shuttled into Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and other
various treatment rooms. A sick, fat, bald elderly woman
coughs as she passes. Adam winces in disgust.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
This way my baby.
George leads Adam into a Chemotherapy Treatment room.
INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - LATER
Adam is seated in a plush leather chair where he’s hooked
into a chemo drip. He's surrounded by three other patients.
An 74 YEAR OLD MAN, who munches on macaroons, a MIDDLE AGED
BALD MAN, and a BALD WOMAN, who knits as she listens to music
on her headphones, a Zen look on her face.
ALAN (84), sitting next Adam, whispers to him:
ALAN
(to Adam)
Want a macaroon?
ADAM
Thanks. I’m alright.
Adam looks down to see that Alan is holding box of macaroons.
ALAN
(whispering)
There’s weed in ‘em.
Adam looks to the middle aged man, MITCH (55), who smiles at
Adam as he pops a macaroon in his mouth.
ADAM
I don’t do weed.
ALAN
C’mon. Just get high with us!
Adam reluctantly eats a macaroon. Mitch leans over, stoned as
hell.
MITCH
How old are you?
ADAM
Twenty-seven.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ALAN
That’s just the worst? A perfectly
good youth wasted.
MITCH
Alan, stop it. Don’t listen to him,
he's just messing with you.
ALAN
(To Adam)
Listen to me, this cancer is bull
shit. First your hair’s going to
fall out, then your balls’ll
shrink. And if that isn’t enough,
your dick becomes a constant source
of disappointment.
Alan and Mitch laugh like two teenagers.
ADAM
I got to tell you, I was really
nervous about this whole cancer
thing, and then I met you guys, and
boy do I feel better.
Alan and Mitch laugh.
ALAN
(to Adam)
I’m Alan Lombardo: stage 3
lymphoma. Pleased to meet you.
MITCH
Mitch Barnett, metastatic prostate
cancer.
ADAM
Oh, I’m Adam Lerner, schwannoma
neurofibrosarcoma.
ALAN
What the fuck is that?
MITCH
Tough break. The more syllables,
the worse it is.
Alan and Mitch laugh. Adam pops another macaroon in his
mouth.
ADAM
These are really good.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
MITCH
Thanks, my wife made ‘em.
ADAM
(chewing)
...how strong are they?
Stroooong.

ALAN

Adam sits back and closes his eyes. Upbeat music swells...
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER
Adam walks in SLOW MOTION down the same ominous corridor he
entered through before. Only it’s no longer ominous to him.
He wears a big huge goofy smirk on his face as he passes:
--a SICK MAN on a gurney
--an OLD LADY wheezing
--a BODY BAG being carted on a gurney
--a FAMILY crying
Adam stops, stares at all the misery around and laughs...
INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Adam jolts out of bed. His clothes are drenched in sweat. He
quickly runs into the bathroom and throws up. A lot.
Rachael wakes up, and knows she should go to him, but can’t.
Instead, she faintly calls outRACHAEL
Adam, you okay?
Adam says nothing, he just slumps over the toilet seat and
throws up again.
INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE - NEXT DAY
Adam looks and feels terrible. His head pounds, causing him
to rub it. Katherine sits in the chair next to him. Her tone
is a little rigid - masking her lack of experience.
KATHERINE
So how are you feeling after your
first treatment?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ADAM
It feels pretty bad, gotta say. My
head is killing me.
KATHERINE
(empathetic)
Yeah I know. From what I understand
it can be pretty rough. But it will
pass.
She pats Adam on the arm. Her intention is to set Adam at
ease, but the act just makes him more uncomfortable.
Startled, he backs away.
Uh...huh.

ADAM

KATHERINE
I think it’s important to remember
that these side effects are very
normal.
ADAM
Good. I’d hate to think I was
special in any way.
KATHERINE
(nervous)
That’s not what I meant. I was just
trying to reassure you.
ADAM
(terse)
Well, thanks.
KATHERINE
I’m sensing some anger. Which is
good.
ADAM
I’m not angry.
(beat)
Why is that good?
KATHERINE
Because you’re expressing yourself.
You’re dealing with a really
serious illness. That brings up a
lot of emotions.
ADAM
You’re trying to make me freak out,
right? That’s the goal here?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
KATHERINE
I’m not trying to make you freak
out. I just want you to get in
touch with what’s going on inside.
And if you’re angry-ADAM
(angry)
I’m not angry...Let’s do the
relaxation thing... Can we do that?
I want to hear some sitars. Go to
my happy place and feel the warm of
beam of light. Can we do that?
Katherine’s a little shaken by Adam’s outburst. He feels bad although that outburst did feel kind of good.
I see...

KATHERINE

ADAM (CONT’D)
(beat)
I'm sorry...I was being an asshole.
I didn’t mean to say that.
Katherine regains her footing.
KATHERINE
I don’t need you to take care of
me.
(smiles)
I’m trying to take care of you.
Adam nods, hesitant. Katherine exhales and scribbles on a
piece of paper:
KATHERINE (CONT'D)
Listen, there’s a few books I’d
like you to read. A lot of people
find them really helpful. You don’t
have to read them cover-to-cover.
Just take a look to see if they
resonate.
She pats her hand on Adam’s shoulder.
ADAM
I’m sorry, are you going to keep
touching me like that?
KATHERINE
What? This?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)
Katherine puts her hand back on Adam’s shoulder. Adam pulls
away.
ADAM
Yeah. That.
KATHERINE
(frustrated)
I’m trying to help you
feel more at ease.
Adam imitates Katherine’s touching.
ADAM
That’s supposed to make me feel
more at ease? It’s like being
slapped by a sea otter.
KATHERINE
Touching promotes trust. It’s one
of the key ways that hospital
practitioners can help patients
feel more secure in stressful
situations.
ADAM
That’s, um, it’s not -- comforting.
Sorry.
KATHERINE
Really, sea otter? Is this better?
Katherine tries again. This time it’s too gentle.
ADAM
Now it’s just getting creepy.
INT. ADAM’S BATHROOM - DAY
Adam stands in front of the mirror. Kyle stands behind him,
tying a towel around his neck.
KYLE
I think you’re making a big, big
mistake. Please don’t do this.
ADAM
What are you talking about?
KYLE
What if you have some weird
Gorbachev bird shit thing on your
head?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ADAM
I thought you liked this idea?
KYLE
I liked the idea in theory. Now
that we’re standing here about to
do it, I’m a little worried you’re
going to look like fucking Michael
Stipe.
ADAM
We have to do it.
KYLE
I’m not going to do it!
ADAM
You said you would!
KYLE
I changed my mind - because if it
looks bad, you’ll blame me every
time you see your weird screwed up
bald head.
Adam grabs the PAIR OF CLIPPERS and goes in for the shave. He
pauses.
ADAM
Wait...what do you use this for?
Adam’s eyes widen.
KYLE
You know, my body.
ADAM
When was the last time you cleaned
it?
Kyle wipes the clippers on his shirt.
Right now.

KYLE

Adam takes the clippers and proceeds to shave his head. Kyle
covers his eyes in horror.
KYLE
Fuck! Dude! Holy Shit!
After a beat, Kyle grabs the trimmers and joins in.
Once finished, Adam looks at his bald head in the mirror.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
ADAM
It looks okay, right?
KYLE
No. It looks really weird.
ADAM
Why didn’t we go to a barber?
KYLE
That would have been a much better
idea -- if we had paid someone to
do it.
ADAM
Instead of using your balls trimmerKYLE
And I never wash them, ever. And
it’s not my balls, it’s my
asshole....I’m joking...
ADAM
You’re not joking.
KYLE
No, I’m not.
INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - DAY
Adam, Alan and Mitch sit in their chairs, attached to their
CHEMO DRIPS. Adam looks SLIGHTLY WORN.
MITCH
How come we’ve never met Rachael?
ALAN
Yeah. What the fuck?
ADAM
Hospitals kind of freak her out.
Alan and Mitch look at each other and groan.
What?

ADAM

MITCH
(being delicate)
Well Adam, no one likes going to
the hospital. That’s not why people
go--

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Adam looks at him.
ADAM
No, you don’t get it. She doesn’t
want the negative mixing with the
positive...it’s an energy thing.
ALAN
Sounds to me like a bullshit thing.
Adam takes this in.
ADAM
You guys can meet her after. She’s
picking me up. I’m sure she’d like
to meet you all...She’s really
great, you guys.
ALAN
(not convinced)
Okay.
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DUSK
Adam, standing next to Mitch and Alan, is on his cell phone.
ADAM
Hey it’s me again, just checking to
see if you’re close...Talk to you
soon.
He hangs up the phone.
ALAN
Sure you don’t need a ride, kid?
ADAM
Oh no, she’s gonna come. I’m sure
she’s just caught up with
something. You guys should head
out, you can meet her next time.
ALAN
Yeah. Sure.
Alan and Mitch give him a sympathetic look at Adam and then
walk off together.

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Adam’s seated on the steps out front. He looks exhausted.
Rachael’s Prius speeds into the parking lot and stops in
front of him.
RACHAEL
Adam! I know. I’m sorry. Please
don’t be mad.
ADAM
I’ve been calling you for an hour.
RACHAEL
My cell phone died.
ADAM
You don’t have to do this, you
know.
RACHAEL
(remorseful)
I’m sorry. I am. I know, I fucked
up.
ADAM
I even gave you an out.
RACHAEL
I’m doing my best...Can we just go
home?
Adam gets in the car, pissed, and they drive off.
INT. BOOKSTORE. SELF HELP SECTION - DAY
Adam and Kyle browse through shelves of books. Adam consults
Katherine’s list of books. Kyle grabs the book, and rather
then hand it to Adam, he reads the AUTHOR’S BIO on the back
jacket of the book.
KYLE
(in excitement)
“Kasper Schlegel is an American
‘medical intuitive’ and ‘mystic
psychiatrist’”. ‘Mystic
psychiatrist’? What is he like
Frodo’s psychiatrist? Why would you
buy that?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ADAM
Because my therapist said I should (shrugs)
I don’t know.
Kyle ditches the book and picks up one on Mardi Gras.
KYLE (CONT’D)
Let’s go to Mardi Gras!
ADAM
I have a girlfriend, why would I go
to Mardi Gras?
KYLE
Oh yeah, your girlfriend, I forgot.
Why go to Mardi Gras when you could
be here, not getting hand jobs and
blow jobs?
From across the store, Kyle notices CLAIRE (30), an
attractive employee stacking books.
KYLE
(frustrated)
Well if you’re not going to take
advantage of this, then I am.
Kyle yanks the list of books from Adam and crosses to Claire.
He throws on a charming smile.
Hi-

KYLE (CONT’D)

Noticing Claire’s name tag.
KYLE
Claire. Kyle. Could you help me
find a few books, please?
Sure.

CLAIRE

Kyle hands Claire the list of book titles. She reads.
Oh.

CLAIRE

(Concerned)
Are these for you?...I’m sorry it’s
none of my business.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
KYLE
No, thank God. Actually, they’re
for my friend. The little guy in
the hat.
Kyle nods towards Adam across the room.
KYLE
He’s my buddy, he’s really, really
sick.
Claire shoots Adam a look - the way one looks at a dying
puppy. Adam looks on in confusion.
How awful.

CLAIRE

KYLE
Yeah. He has ‘Type Four Back
Cancer’ - not cool.
Poor guy.

CLAIRE

KYLE
I know. It’s been really hard.
(Feigning sadness)
But I don’t focus on that, I focus
on the positive, by taking him out
to book stores. I like to take him
for walks. Plays. While he has
time.
CLAIRE
That’s so nice of you.
Claire leads Kyle off to a stack of books.
INT/EXT. BOOKSTORE - LATER
As Adam and Kyle exit the bookstore, they pass Claire.
KYLE
(to Claire)
I’ll see you tonight.
Then as they exit, and walk along the sidewalk, Kyle can’t
help but boast of his achievement; rubbing it in Adam’s face.
KYLE
Thank you, Claire! Nice to meet
you, Claire!

INT. ADAM’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Adam’s lying on the couch with a cold washcloth on his head
watching TV. The phone rings. He snatches it, checks caller
ID: “Mom”. He presses “Ignore”. He checks his RECENT CALLS.
The screen reads “Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.” On cue, his land
line rings. Frustrated, he answers.
What, Mom?

ADAM

DIANE’S VOICE
Jesus, what took so long to pick
up? Are you okay?
ADAM
I’m fine. I didn’t hear the phone
ring.
DIANE’S VOICE
Do you need anything? I was about
to go to the Rite-Aid for your
father...You want me to come over?
I can bring dinner. I can make
macaroni and cheese.
ADAM
Mom, I haven’t liked macaroni and
cheese since I was like ten.
(softens)
It’s all right, Rachael’s going to
come over later.
You sure?

DIANE’S VOICE

ADAM
Yes. I’m totally fine...
In WIDE SHOT, Adam sits alone in his house. Seemingly not
fine.
ADAM
...Don’t worry so much.
DIANE
All right. If you say so. I love
you.
ADAM
Love you too.

INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT
A hip gallery opening. Kyle and Claire have drinks and stare
at awful art.
KYLE
This one is really cool!
CLAIRE
(beat)
My friend did this, actually.
KYLE
(laughs)
No way! Your friend is a real
talent.
Claire moves on to another piece.
CLAIRE
So what do you think of this one?
Kyle turns and looks.
KYLE
Uh oh! I think I have a new
favorite!...This is genius...It’s
making me a little emotional.
Just then Kyle sees Rachael across the crowded room.
KYLE (CONT’D)
Of course, I should have known I’d
see her. We’re at a fucking gallery
opening.
CLAIRE
Who is she?
KYLE
You know my best friend, the one
who’s sick? That’s his pretentious
girlfriend.
They follow Rachael as she walks up to a WHITE GUY WITH
DREADLOCKS and flirts with him.
CLAIRE
She doesn’t look like someone’s
girlfriend.
Just then Rachael gives the guy a passionate, deep kiss.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KYLE
Fuck! I knew it!
The kiss goes on long enough for Kyle to take out his cell
phone and snap a picture.
KYLE (CONT’D)
(ecstatic)
I nailed that cunt!
(to Claire)
Can you believe it?!
Claire walks away, disgusted. Kyle quickly follows after her.
KYLE
Sorry - I - uh, don’t usually use
words like that.
INT. ADAM’S LIVING ROOM - LATER
Adam is asleep on the couch when he hears Rachael come in.

Hi.

ADAM
(sleepy)

RACHAEL
Didn’t mean to wake you.
ADAM
(reaching for her)
Come here.
RACHAEL
Oh, I’m so tired. Can we just get
into bed?
She holds out a hand to help him up just as Kyle opens the
front door.
KYLE
Hey! Surprise! It’s Kyle! What’s
happening, guys?
He couldn’t be in a better mood.
ADAM
(confused)
Hey Kyle.
KYLE (CONT’D)
...bad time? Am I interrupting
something?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ADAM
Well it’s midniKYLE (CONT’D)
Sorry, I was in the neighborhood. I
had a date with Claire, the
bookstore girl. It did not go well,
due to a lack of chemistry and I
think an overuse of profanity on my
part. But, whilst on my date, I ran
into - Rachael.
Oh yeah?

ADAM

Kyle pulls out his cell phone.
KYLE (CONT’D)
I would like to present...
Kyle holds the phone to Adam’s face.
KYLE (CONT’D)
Exhibit...whore!
On the camera screen is a very grainy picture of Rachael
kissing the guy at the gallery.
KYLE (CONT’D)
Look! Look at it!!! That’s Rachael!
And that’s a fucking dirty Jesus
looking motherfucker, and they’re
kissing! I did it!
(to Rachael)
I FUCKING NAILED YOU!!! I’ve hated
you for months! And now I have
evidence that you suck as a person!
Kyle looks at Adam and Rachael’s silent faces.
KYLE
Nothing?
(beat)
You two should probably talk about
this...
He steps into the kitchen.
ADAM
You’re cheating on me!?
RACHAEL
No! I mean - yes but-

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
Seriously?

ADAM

RACHAEL
(coming apart)
Adam - you have no idea how hard
it’s been! I don’t know how to do
this, and it’s been so stressful,
and you’ve been so sick, and shit,
you’re the one who told me Kyle
keeps using your cancer to get
girls! Why should I be the bad guy?
KYLE (O.S.)
Because you’re his girlfriend, and
you cheated on him while he has
cancer, you fucking lunatic!
RACHAEL
(ignoring Kyle)
Adam. We had problems long before
you got sick. And then when you got
sick, I didn’t know what to do.
ADAM
So why are you here? Why do you
spend every night in my bed?
RACHAEL
(quietly)
I don’t know. I didn’t want to
abandon you.
(beat)
Let’s go to bed, we can talk about
this tomorrow.
Speechless, Adam sits on the couch: humiliated, heartbroken,
ruined. Kyle re-enters.
KYLE
I can’t stay in the kitchen any
longer.
(to Rachael)
You got to get out of here! You’re
making this way too uncomfortable
for everyone. Just leave!
Kyle leads her to the door. She resists.
RACHAEL
Adam, we’ll talk tomorrow.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)
KYLE
No you won’t! Why would you talk
tomorrow?
RACHAEL
Adam, I care about you...Adam.
KYLE
You are reprehensible!
RACHAEL
(to Kyle)
Will you shut up?!
(to Adam)
Kyle doesn’t have your best
interest in mind.
KYLE
I don’t? Cause I’m pretty sure I’m
not the one who got caught making
out with some disgusting hippie.
Fuck you!

RACHAEL

KYLE
You’re disgusting!
Rachael slams the door and leaves.
INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Adam lies in bed. He looks over at Rachael’s empty spot. He
inhales, feeling very alone.
Just then Skeletor jumps up and lies down next to him,
practically upending the bed. Adam looks at him, pets him.
EXT. STREET - NEXT DAY
Adam and Kyle are out walking Skeletor.
KYLE
This is the best thing that could
have happened to you.
Why?

ADAM

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KYLE
You deserve better, way better. If
I was your girlfriend, I’d be
baking you cookies and blowing you
every thirty minutes...
ADAM
What kind of cookies?
Any kind.

KYLE

ADAM
Would you make me Snickerdoodle
cookies?
KYLE
I’d bathe you in Snickerdoodle.
ADAM
This conversation is making me
nauseous.
Actually?

KYLE

ADAM
No, that was a joke.
Just then an attractive girl, BODI, walking a dog approaches
Adam.
BODI
Hi! What’s his name?
Skeletor.

ADAM

BODI
This is Marlowe.
KYLE
Why hello Marlowe!
BODI
You guys live around here?
KYLE
We sure do.
Bodi bends over and pets Skeletor.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
BODI
I love greyhounds.
(to Skeletor)
Hellllooo. You’re a good ol’ boy.
Nervous, Adam suddenly gets very protective of Skeletor.
ADAM
We should go, he doesn’t like the
cold.
(to Bodi)
Nice to meet you.
BODI
Nice to meet you!
Adam pulls Skeletor away. The girl continues on her way.
KYLE
You could’ve fucked that girl, you
realize that, don’t you?
ADAM
No one wants to have sex with me.
Look at me - I look like Voldemort.
KYLE
You could’ve asked her to go on a
doggie date, whipped out the cancer
card, fuck the shit out of her!
Adam thinksADAM
You really think a girl’s gonna go
for me just because I have cancer?
KYLE
I know it. Help me, help you get
laid.
ADAM
You think that would work?
KYLE
It would totally work!
Adam thinks more.
ADAM
Let’s do it.

INT. BAR - NIGHT
The bar is loud and packed with Seattle hipsters. With no
room to move, Adam and Kyle stand pressed against the bar
counter. The room is hot and Adam’s knit hat is causing him
to sweat uncontrollably. Adam scans the crowd - this is
definitely not his scene. A very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN leans into
the bar.
KYLE
Lot’s of hot girls. Good odds
tonight. Ok, over there, blue
shirt? Go for it.
Yeah?

ADAM

KYLE
Just talk, spark up a conversation.
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN #1
(to the bartender)
One PBR.
Adam leans over to the woman, yelling above the music:
ADAM
How’s it going?
The woman doesn’t even look at him. Kyle leans in.
KYLE
Get into the cancer thing faster.
Faster?

ADAM

KYLE
It’s your hook man.
ADAM
So that’s the first thing I say?
‘Hello, I have cancer.’
KYLE
It’s what sets you apart. You’re
sympathetic. Just try it.
OK.

ADAM

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN #2 (30) squeezes in next to him. She
drunkenly bobs her head to the song as she orders a drink.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Adam reluctantly looks over at the woman.
ADAM
(to the woman)
I love this song.
Totally.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN #2

ADAM
I have cancer.
Kyle pulls Adam away as the girl looks on, weirded out.
KYLE
I was wrong, I was wrong. Doesn’t
work like that. It doesn’t sound
cool.
INT. BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
Kyle’s talking to two girls in their mid twenties, ALLISON
and JACKIE. Adam stands alone in the distance.
KYLE
I’m Kyle, how’s it going?
Allison.
Jackie.

ALLISON
JACKIE

Kyle shakes their hands.
KYLE
Allison, Jackie. It’s my birthday
today.
ALLISON
Happy birthday!
The girls raise their beers and toast Kyle.
Cheers!

ALLISON

KYLE

Kyle points out Adam.

KYLE
One second.
Kyle rushes over to Adam.
KYLE
I met two girls over there.
ADAM
Are they nice?
KYLE
They are, very nice.
ADAM
Let’s talk to them.
KYLE
Yeah. Take the hat off.
What? No.

ADAM

KYLE
Take it off, take it off.
ADAM
I’m not taking it off.
INT. BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
The bar’s less crowded now. Kyle and Adam are seated in a
booth across from Allison and Jackie.
ADAM
What do you all do?
JACKIE
I just designed the website for the
Swiffer-ADAM
(excited)
Are you serious? Sorry, I’m a fan.
I love the Swiffer! I use it for
everything. Sweeping, mopping -well that’s it really, so not
everything.

CONTINUED:
The girls looks bored. Adam looks at Kyle out of the corner
of his eyeKYLE
(mouths)
Do it.
Adam shakes him off.
ADAM
I just got a dog and he’s always
shedding, and with the Swiffer all
I have to do is attach the wet
cloth and boom, I’m done.
JACKIE
Oh, I love dogs. What’s his name?
Skeletor.

ADAM

Adam looks back at Kyle then reluctantly pulls off his hat,
revealing his bald head.
ADAM
It’s kind of warm in here, isn’t
it?
JACKIE
(stunned)
Oh wow -- you’re bald.
ADAM
Oh no, it’s just cancer.
Cancer?

ALLISON

ADAM
But don't worry, I’m not
contagious.
JACKIE
Oh my god, what kind of cancer is
it?
Spinal.

ADAM

KYLE
It’s in his spine.

possible. How'd you get that?
ADAM
I don't know, bad mattress?
She laughs. Adam and Kyle look at each other. They’re in.
KYLE
He still has a sense of humor! It’s
inspirational!
JACKIE
Can I touch it? Is that weird?
KYLE
You can do more than touch it!
The girls rub Adam’s bald head.
JACKIE
This is a very nice head.
KYLE
Let’s rub it together.
Kyle reaches out, also rubbing Adam’s head.
KYLE
You know, it’ll grow back if you
rub it enough.
EXT. HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT
Adam slumps against a building, as the Jackie and Allison,
now clearly drunk, order food. Kyle approaches.
KYLE
How you doing? You OK?
ADAM
Please let me go to sleep. All I
want is sleep.
KYLE
No! Do not close your eyes. You’ve
got to keep going! All we have to
do is stay awake until they decide
to go to sleep, because if we’re
there when they do, sex will
happen.

Adam’s eyes flutter.
ADAM
I’m so tired. Can you give me an
approximate time I‘ll be having
sex?
KYLE
In ninety-five minutes...
ADAM
I can’t wait that long.
KYLE
That’s how long it’ll take!
The girls return with two jumbo hot dogs:
JACKIE
You guys want to hit up Lush? I
know the DJ-ADAM
I think I’m actually done for the
night. I’m pretty exhausted.
(feigning)
The chemo really wears you out.
Jackie looks at him, disappointed. Kyle is incredulous.
ADAM
(beat)
But, I have some really potent
medical weed if you want to come
over.
ALLISON
That sounds cool.
KYLE
Great idea! Let’s get a cab!
Psyched beyond belief, Kyle nudges Adam.
KYLE
(whispers to Adam)
That was pimp! Very impressive.
Adam smiles at Kyle.

INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM. NIGHT
Jackie and Adam lie in bed. She’s on top of him, eyes closed
SCREWING HIS BRAINS OUT. Adam looks miserable. With each
thrust, he winces in pain.
JACKIE
Am I hurting you?
No.

ADAM

JACKIE
Are you sure?
ADAM
Actually, yeah. It does-JACKIE
Sorry, I’ll just get off you.
Jackie rolls off him. They lie next to each other awkwardly.
INT. ADAM’S KITCHEN- DAWN
In the rising light of dawn, Adam, in boxers and t-shirt,
pours himself some water from a Brita. He puts it back in the
fridge. He turns, enters the
INT. ADAM’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kyle and Allison lie on the couch, both naked under a
blanket, watching a gratuitously violent film on TV.
KYLE
I wonder what the machine gun
budget on this film was.
ALLISON
Can we watch something else?
KYLE
No, I want to see how it ends.
Adam stands in the doorway. Kyle locks eyes with him. Adam’s
not happy or sad - just lost. Kyle forces a smile. Adam
shrugs and walks back into the bedroom.
MONTAGE VARIOUS DOCTOR’S APPOINTMENT

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY
Katherine walks to her car. She notices Adam sitting alone at
the BUS STOP.
Adam?

KATHERINE

ADAM
(embarrassed)
Oh hey.
KATHERINE
What are you doing?
ADAM
Waiting for the bus.
KATHERINE
(beat)
I’m on my way home right now - want
a ride?
ADAM
Oh, I’m used to the bus, but thank
you.
KATHERINE
I can’t let you take the bus.
ADAM
I live kind of far away.
KATHERINE
Won’t take no for an answer.
INT. KATHERINE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
Adam is seated in the front seat as Katherine drives. The car
is filthy - it’s littered with papers, magazines, food
wrappers, etc. Katherine’s body is pressed all the way up
against the steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KATHERINE
Sorry about the mess. I’m not very
good at getting rid of things.
ADAM
Yeah, I can see.
KATHERINE
Let me know if you need me to pull
over...I know that the chemotherapy
can make you...you know...nauseous.
Silent beat as they both stare out the windshield, unsure
what to say.
KATHERINE
So, you don’t have a car?
ADAM
No. Don’t even have a license.
Why not?

KATHERINE

ADAM
It’s incredibly dangerous.
(beat)
It’s the fifth leading cause of
death. Only a couple after cancer.
KATHERINE
Still. The bus. The bus after
chemo.
ADAM (CONT'D)
Rachael usually drives me -- but we
broke up.
KATHERINE
What? When did this happen?
ADAM
A few days ago. She kind of cheated
on me.
KATHERINE
Oh. Adam. Do you want to talk about
it?
Adam’s about to answer when...
ADAM
No. Nuh-uh. No therapy. You are
giving me this ride as a friend.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
Adam--

KATHERINE

ADAM
(looking around)
You know what we could talk about?
All of this mess. Are you aware of
the bacteria that’s probably living
in here?
KATHERINE
Adam, your girlfriend cheated on
you-(beat)
I know what’s it’s like. Break ups
suck, I just broke up with someone
a few months ago.
I’m sorry.

ADAM

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
It’s fine. I ended it.
ADAM
How long were you two together?
KATHERINE
Three months -(uncomfortable)
And we shouldn’t be talking about
this.
ADAM
Why not? You know every thing about
me.
KATHERINE
I just don’t think it’s appropriate
for me to be telling you all this
personal stuff. The whole
therapist/patient relationship
doesn’t work if you know all my
problems.
She smiles, awkward.
KATHERINE
Admittedly, I do check his Facebook
page everyday to see if he’s dating
someone new. So pathetic(beat)
Probably shouldn’t have said that.
We can just listen to the radio.

Adam thinks for a beat. Then looks at the floor, looks at the
pile of garbage at his feet.
ADAM
(abrupt)
Stop the car.
Katherine looks at Adam nervously.
KATHERINE
Why? What’s wrong? Are you okay?
ADAM
Just stop the car.
Katherine stops the car. Adam grabs a handful of her garbage
and gets out.
KATHERINE
What are you doing?
ADAM
I can’t handle all this mess.
KATHERINE
Are you serious?
Adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the
car for more. Katherine laughs as she gets out and joins him.
KATHERINE
Wait, no, not that. That’s my
dinner.
Which one?
This.

ADAM
KATHERINE

Katherine grabs a food container from Adam’s hands.
ADAM
You’re going to eat that?
KATHERINE
Don’t judge me.
They leave Katherine’s dinner behind, then throw out the rest
of the garbage.

EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DUSK
Adam and Katherine arrive at Adam's house.
ADAM
Well, this is me. Thanks for the
ride.
KATHERINE
No problem. Thanks for cleaning my
car.
Adam looks at his house. The lights are out. He’s really not
in the mood to be alone. He gives out a deep sigh and then
gets out of his car.
ADAM (CONT'D)
I’ll see you next week.
KATHERINE
You’ll be all right? By yourself?
ADAM
Yeah. Totally. I’m fine.
He gets out of the car and walks away. Katherine looks after
him, with concern. She rolls down her window.
Hey--

KATHERINE

Adam turns around.
KATHERINE (CONT'D)
I want you to have my cell number.
Call me if you ever need anything.
Katherine scribbles her cell phone on a piece of paper and
hands it to Adam.
ADAM
(teasing)
Did I just score your digits?
Katherine turns red.

No.

KATHERINE
(uncomfortable)

ADAM
That was a joke.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KATHERINE
(awkward)
That’s fine. Jokes make for a good
coping mechanism...This is only for
emergencies.

Or if you need someone to talk
to...Good night.
ADAM
Good night.
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Adam and Kyle smoke a mini-bong bubbler as they watch “Planet
Earth” on a brand new 50” flat screen TV. Skeletor is asleep
on the floor.
KYLE
I thought the desert was crazy. The
ocean’s fucking nuts, man.
ADAM
I like the trees.
KYLE
The trees are going to be bananas.
There’s a knock at the door. Too engrossed in the TV, neither
guy moves. Rachael pops her head in the door. She looks at
Adam nervously as he puts on his hat, covering his bald head.
RACHAEL
Hey -- I’m just here to pick up my
things and then I’ll be out of your
way.
Adam does his best to play it cool.
ADAM
I put all of your things in a box.
It’s outside the door on the porch.
KYLE
Walked right past it.
RACHAEL
Oh. Okay. Well then I guess I’ll be
on my way.
(then noticing)
Are you smoking weed?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Yeah.

ADAM

RACHAEL
Since when do you smoke?
ADAM
It’s medicinal.
RACHAEL
(impressed)
You got a prescription for
medicinal marijuana?
KYLE
No, I got a prescription for
medicinal marijuana, Adam was too
afraid.
RACHAEL
What’s wrong with you?
KYLE
I have night blindness. Rods and
cones are eschew, and weed fixes
it.
Rachael grins and rolls her eyes. She notices the new TV,
which has replaced her painting on the wall. The painting
sits stashed in the corner. Sadness sweeps across her face.
RACHAEL
(disappointed)
You took my painting down.
KYLE
It didn’t really fit there with the
new TV.
RACHAEL
Adam, can I talk to you outside for
a second please?
EXT. ADAM'S PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
Adam and Rachael exit Adam’s house and sit on the porch
stoop.
RACHAEL
So...how are you feeling?
ADAM
Pretty awesome.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
RACHAEL
I wanted to tell you I’m sorry.
ADAM
(contrite)
I’m sorry too, I know this wasn’t
easy for you. And I’m sorry I
didn’t come to your opening, it’s
only because I hate you so much.
RACHAEL
(embarrassed)
I’m glad you didn’t come. It was a
complete disaster. No one bought
any of my paintings.
ADAM
(smiles)
Really?...But they’re...so...great.
Really?

RACHAEL

ADAM
Yeah, you’ll get it next time.
She hugs him.
RACHAEL
I don’t want to break up. I can be
better. We can start over again.
She kisses him.
RACHAEL
I’ll just be better.
He kisses back. After a beat.
ADAM
You should go.
She continues kissing him. He continues kissing back. He
struggles to pull back, but does. He stares at her, shakes
his headADAM (CONT’D)
Please...I need you to get the fuck
off of my porch now.
Rachael looks at Adam, pissed, hurt, ego shattered. She picks
up her belongings, turns and walks toward her car.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
Adam notices Rachael’s painting still on the porch.
ADAM (CONT’D)
Your painting.
RACHAEL
I made it for you.
Rachael continues to her car. A beat. Adam then gets up off
the porch and walks inside.
EXT. ADAM’S BACKYARD - DAY
TIGHT ON: Rachael’s Painting.
Adam and Kyle are hammering it to a tree. From a box of
various supplies, they pull out the following items and
destroy the painting: kitchen knives, screw driver, garlic
press, a Molotov cocktail made out of hair-spray, eggs,
orange juice, shaving cream, and an ax.
Adam and Kyle look down at the destroyed painting.
ADAM
It actually looks a lot better.
KYLE
It’s not that bad.
ADAM
Yeah, we could hang this up.
EXT. MITCH’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - DAY
Adam, Kyle, Mitch and Alan laugh hysterically as they smoke a
joint.
ADAM
(to Alan)
You were around before TV, right?
Because I want to hear about the
radio...They talk about people just
sitting around and listening to the
radio-ALAN
Glued to the radio.
ADAM
What did you listen to?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ALAN
“Little Orphan Annie”.
KYLE
What did you look at when you were
listening, nothing?
ALAN
It engaged everything.
ADAM
I’m doing a radio piece on a
volcano.
KYLE
I do radio I think people will
actually like. Mostly stuff about
food...Like hamburger. People like
listening to that versus “Coming up
next, a volcano!”.
MITCH
You know what I’d do? I’d turn on
the TV.
ADAM
It’s not the same.
Just then, an attractive fifty-something woman, BERNIE,
carries out a tray of wheatgrass.
MITCH
Thank you, sweetheart. Bernie just
blended up some wheatgrass. Beware,
it’s like drinking liquid lawn
cuttings.
(beat)
Oh, Bernie, this is Adam.
ADAM
Hi. This is my friend Kyle.
Kyle takes a sip of wheatgrass and nearly gags.
BERNIE
(re: wheatgrass)
You like it?
KYLE
(in disgust)
It’s not good.
Bernie smiles, amused by Kyle, then turns back to Adam.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
BERNIE
So, you’re Adam? From the way Mitch
described you I thought you were
much older.
KYLE
He was eighty-five years old when
he was three.
Mitch looks at his wife adoringly and takes her hand.
Come here.

MITCH

Mitch pulls her close her for a kiss. Adam looks at them,
envious, a thin smile on his face.
INT. KATHERINE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Adam walks in, flustered and annoyed as he talks to his mom
on the phone. He sits down -- wrapping up the conversation.
ADAM
(annoyed)
Mom it’s not a virus!...No, it’s
the screen saver.
Adam mouths sorry to Katherine.
ADAM (CONT’D)
...Please, I’m telling you, just
move the mouse...mom I can’t talk
now. I have an appointment. Yes,
right now. I’m standing inside the
office as we speak...I don’t know
what I’m making for
dinner...something, I’ll figure it
out.
Adam looks at Katherine, embarrassed.
ADAM (CONT’D)
...Mom, I really have to go. OK,
hanging up the phone now. OK, I
know...Love you too.
Adam hangs up the phone. Takes a deep breath.
ADAM (CONT’D)
Sorry about that.

CONTINUED:
KATHERINE
Don’t worry about it. I have
parents too.
Adam grimaces.
ADAM
Do yours give you migraines?
KATHERINE
My parents are something I would
talk about with my therapist.
Really?

ADAM

KATHERINE
Yeah, we could role play. I can be
your mom.
ADAM
(repulsed)
Oh God, no. That’s disgusting.
KATHERINE
Why is that disgusting?
Adam sighs.
ADAM
My mom is a crazy person who
worries incessantly. Honestly, it
annoys the shit out of me. And it’s
not helpful...I can’t talk to her.
Katherine thinks - connects the dots in her head.
KATHERINE
So now she has a husband she can’t
talk to, and a son who won’t talk
to her.
Adam’s taken aback by Katherine’s bluntness.
ADAM
Well, yeah, I guess.
KATHERINE
I mean, aren’t you being kind of a
dick?
ADAM
I’m sorry? Is that a medical term?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
KATHERINE
Your parents are who they are, you
can’t change that. The only thing
you can change is how you choose to
deal with them.
ADAM
Aren’t you supposed to subtly
manipulate me into being aware of
my faults? Not call me out.
KATHERINE
I think we’re beyond that point.
You did clean my car.
Katherine looks at Adam with tenderness, grabs hold of his
shoulder, squeezing it.
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
(frustrated)
It’s weird, isn’t it? Shouldn’t
have done it. Shouldn’t have gone
for it.
ADAM
No, it was good, it was good.
KATHERINE
No, it wasn’t. It’s so forced.
ADAM
Here try again, I was too far. Come
in a little closer.
He inches closer to her, and sticks out his shoulder.
KATHERINE
I’m going to make it real natural.
Katherine places a hand on him, testing.
ADAM
That was better.
They share a smile. After a beat Katherine looks down - self
consciously.

Adam sits down next to Alan, but notices there’s no Mitch.

ADAM
Where’s Mitch?
ALAN

He died last night.
ADAM

What does it matter, his heart
stopped.
They can’t look at one another.
EXT. LINDEN CEMETERY - DAY
Kyle’s car drives up the cemetery’s long driveway.
EXT. LINDEN CEMETERY - DAY
Dressed for a funeral, Adam and Kyle walk through the grounds
passing hundreds of tombstones along the way. Adam is morose;
Kyle is trying to cheer him up.
EXT. MITCH’S FUNERAL - DAY
Adam, Kyle and Alan stand next to a MINISTER as he speaks.
Bernie stands in front of them, trying to hold it together.
We PUSH IN on Adam, as the Minister’s voice recedes into the
background.
INT. ADAM’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Adam lights a joint. He turns on the TV. Matlock appears on
his flat screen TV. Adam flips the channels. And finally to
the NEWS -- BREAKING NEWS: MT. MOHA MOHA ERUPTING. Adam
watches the volcano erupt with bittersweet sadness.
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Adam lies on the bed of an MRI machine. His body is slowly
drawn into the scanner.

INT. HOSPITAL. KATHERINE’S OFFICE - DAY
Adam lies on the couch staring at the ceiling.
ADAM
I’m just beginning to realize that
I'm probably going to die.
KATHERINE
Did something happen? Did you get
the MRI results back?
ADAM
No, but look at me, I'm not getting
any better. I look in the mirror
and it’s pretty obvious.
(beat)
Mitch died, Alan’s probably going
to die, and so am I.
KATHERINE
You don’t know that...A lot of what
you’re feeling is from the
treatment.
ADAM
Look. Thank you, but you don’t need
to try and cheer me up. I mean, in
the end, what does it really matter
anyway? We’re all going to die.
You’re just going to die, hopefully
a lot later than I am.
Not expecting this turn from Adam, Katherine’s demeanor
stiffens - she looks anxious.
KATHERINE
Adam, okay, what you’re going
through - is something called “The
Alienation Phase”...And I know
that you’re feeling helpless
inside, but you should know that
this is totally normal for someone
in your situation.
ADAM
(annoyed)
I’m sorry, but, I’m going to have
to call you on that. It’s bullshit.
That’s what everyone has been
saying. “You’ll get better” and
“It’ll be fine”.

ADAM (cont'd)
I don’t know why everyone is so
fucking scared to say it. “You’re

KATHERINE

Adam, I’m here to help you.
ADAM
Why? So that when you’re at some
dinner party in 30 years, you can
tell some inspiring anecdote about
you coached your third patient
through the alienation phase, and
helped him feel “normal” right
before he died.
KATHERINE
Adam...I...I’m sorry - if - I said
the wrong things. IADAM
This isn’t working for me.

Adam leaves. Katherine is overcome with a sense of failure.
INT. ADAM’S HOUSE - DAY
The place is a mess.

Adam dials the phone.

KYLE (V.O.)
Not around. Leave a message.
ADAM
Hey man, it’s Adam. I was wondering
if you could give me a ride to my
doctor’s appointment today...It’s
the big one.
Adam hangs up and hesitates. After a beat, he dials again.
Adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes. A pang of
regret runs through his body.

Hi Mom.

ADAM (CONT’D)

INT. DR ROSS’ OFFICE - DAY
Diane, Adam and Richard are seated in the exam room. Diane
and Adam nervously flip through magazines while Richard is
lost somewhere in his own world. The tension is thick. Diane
looks at her watch and shivers. There’s a knock at the door.
A friendly looking Nurse enters.
FRIENDLY NURSE
The doctor’s just in with another
patient, but should be out in a few
minutes. You guys holding up
alright?
DIANE
It’s very cold in here. Is there
anyway you can turn down the air
conditioning?
FRIENDLY NURSE
Unfortunately the temperature is
controlled by a central thermostat.
DIANE
My son has cancer.
FRIENDLY NURSE
(feels bad)
I’m sorry, really, if I could I
would, but there’s nothing I can

Adam’s pissed that his mother has just involved him.

Diane puts her hand on Adam’s forehead.
DIANE (CONT’D)
You feel warm.
I’m fine.

ADAM

Diane gets up from her chair and paces around the room
looking at the doctor’s various degrees on the wall. Adam
looks on, annoyed at every step his mother takes. Diane
closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading
glasses for further examination.

Huh.

DIANE
(disapproving)

What?

ADAM

DIANE
Oh, nothing.
ADAM
(annoyed)
What?
DIANE
It’s nothing, he went to a state
college.
ADAM
You’re unbelievable.

getting the best care possible.

right.
Adam can’t take it anymore. He explodes.

Diane is so frustrated, she’s near tears:
DIANE
It’s so hard that you don’t let me
help you. It’s really hard.
ADAM
You are helping me. You brought me
here, didn’t you?
They sit in silence for a moment.
ADAM (CONT'D)
What about you?
She looks at him, baffled:
DIANE
What about me?
ADAM
How are you?
DIANE
(wiping her tears)
How am I?
ADAM
How are you? What’s going on in
your life?
DIANE
Seriously? Nothing is going on in

is this cancer support group I’ve
been going to.
ADAM
You’ve been going to a support

DIANE
You don’t have to say you’re sorry.
Adam takes her hand in his. She’s clearly moved. A beat. Dr.
Ross storms into the room carrying a stack of MRI films. He
seems rushed.
DR. ROSS
Sorry to keep you folks waiting.
Adam and Diane look at Dr. Ross with blank stares.
DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
Anyway I’ll cut to the chase. The
cancer’s not responding to the
chemo.
Dr. Ross places the MRI into the light box.
DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
As you can see, the tumor is
continuing to grow here, along the
nerve. We have to remove it now or
we risk metastasis.
Adam and Diane squint to see what Ross is talking about, but
see nothing.
ADAM
So what do we do?
DR. ROSS
We need to operate. Now,
I was able to move some things
around, and I can get you in this
Thursday morning with Dr.
Walderson. He’s one of our best
neurosurgeons.
DIANE
But he’s going to be okay, right?
You’re going to fix it.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (4)
DR. ROSS
Considering the placement and size
of the tumor, a surgery of this
nature is very dangerous, and
potentially life threatening
itself. The surgeons will be very
aggressive in their attempt. But if
we’re unsuccessful in removing the
cancer...then unfortunately we’re
out of options.
Diane takes hold of Adam’s hand. They sit silently as the
doctor’s words soak in.
EXT. PARK - LATER THAT NIGHT
Adam sitting in the park over looking the city. Kyle is drunk
- Adam is still nursing his first beer.
KYLE
I’m not going to bring up the fact
that your surgery is tomorrow. Not
even thinking about it. So don’t
worry about it, cause I’m not going
to bring it up.
ADAM
You remember the last time we came
out here?
KYLE
It was prom night.
ADAM

Adam looks like he’s on the verge of falling apart. Kyle puts

Kyle points at Adam’s head as he stands, then stumbles. He’s
drunk.
ADAM
I know you had fun.
KYLE
You could too, maybe.
ADAM
You’re drunk.
KYLE
It worked! Take your hat off!

Fine, but be careful.
Kyle hands Adam his keys.

Now, first thing you want to do-Without checking the mirrors, he backs the car up. BOOM the
car SLAMS into a BIKE RACK.
KYLE (CONT’D)
What the fuck!
Adam pulls out of the parking lot.
KYLE (CONT’D)
Make a left. Make a left! It’s a
one way street!
Adam turns left onto a one way street. It’s the wrong way.
KYLE (CONT’D)
What the fuck? There’s a car! Wrong
way! Wrong way! Wrong way! What the
hell!
An oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way - only
nearly avoiding a head on collision.
KYLE (CONT’D)
Adam! Stop man - stop!
Kyle pulls the emergency brake. The car stops abruptly.
KYLE (CONT’D)
The fuck are you doing, man? You’re
being an idiot right now.

A beat.
ADAM
Get out. Get out of the car.
Kyle stammers as Adam looks like he’s about to erupt.
GET! OUT!

ADAM

Adam starts hitting Kyle.
KYLE
Jesus Christ!
Kyle looks at Adam speechless, and then gets out of the car.
Adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment. He then
proceeds to scream at the top of his lungs. Twenty seven
years worth of suppressed emotions come out. Adam then sits
in total silence. After a beat, he pulls out his cell phone.
Kyle notices. He tries to open the door. It’s locked. Adam
ignores Kyle and begins to dial.
KYLE (CONT’D)
Don’t you dare call her! Not after
everything she’s done to
you...You’re a pussy, Adam.
ADAM
You’re a selfish piece of shit who
cares more about getting fucking
laid than being my friend.
Kyle looks hurt. Adam holds the phone up to his head.
INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME (INTERCUT)
The phone rings. It’s not Rachael...it’s Katherine. She’s
sitting on her bed, reading a book.
Hello.

KATHERINE

ADAM
(nonchalant)
Hey, it’s Adam.
Adam?

KATHERINE

She looks at the clock, it’s midnight.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KATHERINE
It’s midnight. What’s going on?
ADAM
(still nonchalant)
Oh, just having a nervous
breakdown. I think I fractured my
larynx.
KATHERINE
I’m really, really glad you called.
There’s a long silence. Tears roll down Adam’s face.
ADAM
I want this to be over. I’m so
fucking tired of being sick...if
this surgery doesn’t work, that’s
it -(crying)
I’ve never been to fucking Canada
or told a girl I love her...it
sounds stupid.
KATHERINE
No. It doesn’t.
Katherine’s eyes begin to well.
ADAM (CONT’D)
(beat)
I’m sorry I was such an asshole.
KATHERINE
I was the asshole. I was so totally
unprepared - for you. This job is
really hard. If I fuck up, I could
ruin someone’s whole life.
ADAM
I guess we’re both beginners at
this.
KATHERINE
(smiles)
Yeah.
A beat.
ADAM
What were you doing when I called?
Were you on Facebook?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
KATHERINE
(laughs)
You know, stalking my ex-boyfriend
isn’t the only thing I do in my
free time.
A beat. Adam sighs:
ADAM
I wish you were my girlfriend.
She takes this in, kind of wishing it too.
KATHERINE
Girlfriends can be nice. You just
had a bad one.
ADAM
Yeah, but I bet you’d be a good
one.
Silence as Katherine blushes. Then: There’s a loud knock on
the window. It’s Kyle. He’s freezing.
KYLE
Let me in man, Jesus. It’s fucking
freezing!
ADAM
I’m going to go. Thanks...Thanks
for everything.
KATHERINE
Good night.
Adam hangs up the phone. Kyle bangs on the car window
desperately. Adam finally unlocks the car.
EXT. KYLE’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
Kyle and Adam enter the building.
INT. KYLE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Too drunk to stand, Kyle uses Adam as a crutch to support
himself as they enter his apartment, which is a mess - it
looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in years. Kyle is unusually
quiet. The mood is solemn - these guys never fight.
Kyle keels over to pass out on the couch. Adam walks into the
bathroom.

INT. KYLE’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
With his finger, Adam scoops some dust up off the counter.
Grossed out, he looks around for a towel to wipe the dust off
his hand. No towels. He wipes it off on his jeans. He then
notices something on the ground, in front of the toilet. A
book. He leans over and picks up “Coping with Your Loved
One's Cancer”. The book is worn and has multiple book marks indicating it’s been read. Adam looks out at Kyle, he had him
pegged all wrong. Adam then turns and looks at himself in the
mirror. He takes a deep breath. A beat. He claps his hands the lights turn off.
EXT. SEATTLE STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT
It’s 3 a.m. The streets are completely vacant of life. Adam
walks along this normally busy avenue all alone.
EXT. STREET - DAWN
Adam walks along the sidewalk of his street and turns up his
front walkway.
INT. ADAM’S HOUSE - DAWN
Adam packs a small DUFFEL BAG.
INT. ADAM’S KITCHEN - LATER
Adam kneels down, pours some dog food into a bowl for
Skeletor. He looks at the dog, who looks back, confused.
ADAM
Come here, boy.
Skeletor begins to eat. Adam looks in Skeletor’s eyes and
gives him one last pet.
EXT. ADAM’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Adam steps out onto the porch carrying his duffle bag. As he
walks down the steps, he looks back at his house, takes a
deep breath, and leaves.
I/E. KYLE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Adam gets into Kyle’s car. The mood is eerie and quiet.

INT. KYLE’S CAR - LATER
Kyle and Adam sit silently parked in front of the hospital.
(beat)
You ready?
Yeah.

KYLE

ADAM

KYLE
It’s going to be good. It’s going
to be fine.
Yeah.

ADAM

We hear a voice from across the parking lot.
KYLE
That’s your mom.
Adam rolls down the window. Sure enough, his mom is yelling
from across the parking lotAdam!

DIANE’S VOICE

KYLE
So I’ll park the car I guess, and
then come inside-Yep.

ADAM

KYLE
--and I’ll see you before you go in
there?
ADAM
Um...I’m not sure how it works.
KYLE
Then I’ll see you after...
Yep.

ADAM

Kyle looks at him unsure what to say. Adam leans across and
hugs Kyle.
KYLE
So I’ll see you in there...
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Thanks.

ADAM

Adam steps out of the car and walks across the vast concrete
expanse toward his mother and father who stand waiting for
him.
INT. HOSPITAL PRE-OP ROOM - EARLY MORNING
Adam lies on a gurney. His parents stand beside him. DR.
WALDERSON the neurosurgeon enters.
DR. WALDERSON
Good morning, I’m Dr. Walderson,
I’ll be performing your surgery
today...How are you feeling?
Good.

ADAM

DR. WALDERSON
Good. Good. Good. Good.
Dr. Walderson looks over her chart.
DR. WALDERSON
So we’re going to take excellent
care of you. Our surgical team is
top-notch. You just try to relax.
Adam’s completely terrified. Dr. Walderson exits. Nurse
Stewart hands Adam a giant pile of disclaimers to sign.
ADAM
What is all this?
NURSE STEWART
Standard paperwork: hospital
liability and disclaimer forms and
organ donor authorization.
Richard whispers closely into Adam’s ear:
RICHARD
I got a new coat... Brooks
Brothers. Silk Pockets. Feel.
Adam sticks his hand inside the pocket of Richard’s coat.
Feel.

RICHARD(CONT'D)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ADAM
I am feeling.
Adam looks up at his dad, standing there in his confused
state:
ADAM
Dad, listen. I know it’s probably
hard to follow what’s going on
right now -- but I want you to know
that I love you very much.
Richard looks at his son, blank expression on his face:
RICHARD

OK.
OK, Dad.

ADAM

Adam smiles at his father, and then looks at his mother. DR.
LEE entersDR. LEE
Hello Adam, I’m Dr. Lee -- I’m here
to administer your anesthesia.

Hi.

ADAM
(nervous)

DR. LEE
Now relax, I’m going to inject the
anesthesia through your IV... It’s
going to take a few moments before
you begin to feel the effects...
ADAM
You’re doing it now?
NURSE STEWART
(to Diane and Richard)
If you guys could just head over to
the waiting room that’d be great.
ADAM
How long will it last?
DR. LEE
That really depends on the
individual--

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
ADAM
Well, how do you know if it’s going
to last long enough so I won’t wake
up in the middle of surgery? Or
what if I don’t wake up after? Mom?
DIANE
Sweetie you’re going to be just
fine.
He leans over the bed into his mother’s arms. She holds him
for a long beat.
DR. LEE
I’m really sorry but we’ve got to
get Adam to the operating room.
DIANE (CONT'D)
Could you just wait a moment,
please?
Dr. Lee unlocks Adam’s gurney.
I’m sorry.

DR. LEE

Diane kisses Adam on the cheek.
DIANE
I love you, Adam.
Dr. Lee nods to a couple nurses, who pull Adam’s gurney
through double doors. He disappears into fluorescence.
INT. HOSPITAL SURGICAL AMPHITHEATER - CONTINUOUS
Adam’s gurney is PULLED INTO frame. We push in on Adam’s
unconscious face. Now, several ARMS reach out and grab him,
placing him on the operating table.
SFX: The rhythmic beep of his heart monitor. The echoing
sound of his breath. It initiates a
MONTAGE
--Katherine sits in her office, talking to a patient. She
nods, jots notes, but her head is somewhere else.
--Diane and Richard sit in the waiting room. She holds a
handful of pills. Richard takes them from her. She looks into
his eyes, terrified.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
-- IN A WIDE SHOT, we see the operating table. Two
neurosurgeons, Dr. Walderson and DR. PHILLIPS are in midsurgery. Alongside the two doctors are TWO NURSES.
-- Kyle stands outside the hospital’s front entrance. Next to
him, a couple of NURSES on a smoke break talk animatedly. He
stares ahead, nervous.
-- The operating room is empty. Adam lies on the surgical
table, now face up with an oxygen mask over his mouth. His
eyes are closed and his complexion is cold and pale.
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER
Diane, Richard and Kyle sit together, anxious. Katherine
enters the room and sits across from the others. They
exchange awkward looks.
DIANE
(to Kyle)
It’s been five hours.
Kyle looks over clearly very aware of that fact:
Has it?

KYLE

DIANE
Something’s wrong. We should have
heard by now.
KYLE
Don’t worry. Adam’s going to be
fine, okay?
Katherine hears Adam’s name. She leans over to Kyle, Richard,
and Diane.
KATHERINE
Adam Lerner?
KYLE
(startled)
Yeah.
KATHERINE
Dr. Walderson is one of the best
surgeons in the country, so he’s in
good hands.
DIANE
Who are you?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KATHERINE
I...uh, I’m Katherine.
KYLE
The therapist! I’m Kyle, Adam’s
friend.
They shake hands.
KYLE
These are Adam’s parents.
KATHERINE
It’s nice to meet you.
She smiles and nods awkwardly. Long beat.
KYLE
Did he say I was a dick? ‘Cause I’m
not.
DIANE
I want you to know, I smothered him
because I love him.
Katherine smiles politely.
KYLE
Seriously, did he say anything?
KATHERINE
I...I can’t...I wouldn’t...I
wouldn’t talk about that sort of
thing.
Kyle and Diane turn their attention away from Katherine,
dejected. In the distance, they spot Dr. Walderson. Everyone
jumps up as she approaches:
DR. WALDERSON
Mr. and Mrs. Lerner. So as you can
imagine, with a surgery of this
magnitude...there were some
unforeseen complications. The bone
erosion was much greater than
initially anticipated. We had to
remove part of the hip and pelvis,
as well as most of the right psoas
muscle. We also had to remove a
good amount of sheath tissue around
the sciatic nerve. It’s not going
to be an easy road back, but he’s
going to be okay.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
DIANE
(relieved)
He’s going to be okay?
Dr. Walderson nods.
KYLE
You should start with that
information. That should be the
first thing you say.
He turns to hug Diane:
He’s OK!

KYLE (CONT'D)

Diane and Kyle hug, then pull Richard into the hug.
DIANE
(to Dr. Walderson)
Thank you, doctor, thank you!
Diane and Kyle start crying. Katherine sees this tender
moment and shies away.
INT. HOSPITAL POST-OP RECOVERY - DAY
Adam’s in his hospital bed - still asleep from the surgery.
Richard and Diane enter the room. Adam reacts like a little
kid being picked up from pre-school.
Mommy!

ADAM (CONT’D)

DIANE
(crying)
My little boy.
ADAM
It’s nice here. I got a good room.
I know.

DIANE

ADAM
We need to go on more vacations.
DIANE
Yes, we’ll go on a huge vacation!
We can go to Hawaii!
Kyle awkwardly stands over Adam, trying to act normal.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KYLE
Hey man? What’s up?...I’m afraid to
touch you, but um-Adam sticks out his pinkie which Kyle gently fist bumps.
KYLE
Boom. You look really good.
ADAM
I’m high as a motherfucka.
Kyle looks at Diane with a guilty expression.
KYLE
Um...we don’t do that.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Adam lies in bed. His eyes open, staring at the ceiling. It’s
quiet. Peaceful. Katherine knocks on the door and walks in.
Adam speaks; woozy from the morphine, and very weak:
It’s you.
It is me.

ADAM
KATHERINE

She stands next to the bed.
KATHERINE
How are you feeling?
ADAM
Grrreat. I love morphine...What
time is it?
KATHERINE
It’s eight o’clock. I was just
working late, so I thought I’d stop
by.
ADAM
(wide smile)
Working late - you got a new
patient?
KATHERINE
I got a few new patients, actually.
ADAM
That’s good.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Adam smiles. Looks into her eyes for a long beat.
ADAM
I’d like to make you pancakes some
time.
KATHERINE
That’s very nice, Adam.
ADAM
(dead serious)
You’re going to like them.
Katherine laughs. She sits next to him on the bed, and takes
hold of his hand. Unlike her previous attempts, this time her
grip is perfect. Adam notices.
ADAM
I’m peeing right now.
KATHERINE
I’m not going to look.
We stay on Adam and Katherine looking into each other’s eyes
as Katherine moves her hand down his arm, finally clasping
his hand in hers.
I/E. ADAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
CLOSE-UP ON: WOUND
ANGLE ON: Kyle, staring at the wound with trepidation,
absolutely disgusted.
KYLE
Ugh, it’s gross! Oh God - I keep
looking back at it thinking it’s
going to be less gross.
The wound is revealed to be on Adam’s back. Adam -- hair
slowly beginning to grow back, looking much healthier,
relaxed -- looks back at Kyle.
ADAM
Can we just get it over with? Come
on.
KYLE
Your mom does this?
ADAM
She does it all the time.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KYLE
This is like some “Saw” shit.
ADAM
(unaffected)
Your words are so comforting.
KYLE
I’m just gonna do it, I’m gonna act
like it’s nothing.
Kyle puts a gob of antibiotic ointment on his finger and very
tentatively reaches towards Adam’s back.
ADAM
I’m going to be really proud of
you.
KYLE
Ugh! I’m doing it. I’m inside you!
Adam looks over his shoulder, notices Kyle applying the
ointment.
ADAM
Wait, wait, wait, is that your
finger?
What?

KYLE

ADAM
Is that your finger?

No.

KYLE
(guilty)

ADAM
There’s Q-Tips!
KYLE
I know, I know...
Kyle quickly applies some ointment on a Q-TIP.
ADAM
That was your finger, wasn’t it!
KYLE
Would it be bad if it was?
ADAM
Did you wash your hands?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
KYLE
I used a Q-Tip the whole time,
don’t worry about it.
Kyle swabs the wound with the Q-Tip.
KYLE
This looks like Kuato from “Total
Recall”.
Adam grabs his back to imitate Kuato.
ADAM
The oxygen!
KYLE
(disgusted)
No! Don’t do that! Ugh!
Kyle feebly applies the DRESSING on Adam’s wound.
ADAM
Can we get this going? It’s seven
thirty. Come on, put on the
bandage.
Kyle gingerly applies the bandage whilst turning his head.
Wound now covered, Kyle looks self-assured -- it’s a pretty
shoddy job.
KYLE
And you, are ready for your date!
Adam gingerly stands and buttons up his shirt. He walks over
and looks in the mirror. He rubs his short hair in
contemplation.
ADAM
It’s crazy. I look pretty good.
KYLE
I’d fuck you.
ADAM
(smiles)
Thanks.
The DOORBELL rings. Adam looks at Kyle, a bit nervous.
KYLE (CONT’D)
(excited)
Who could that be? Go answer it,
go!

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)
Adam takes a deep breath and opens the front door. He lights
up when he sees KATHERINE standing in front of him. She’s
holding a PIZZA.
Hey.
Hi.

ADAM
KATHERINE

ADAM
You look nice.
KATHERINE
Thanks.
(awkward beat)
You too. You look super nice.
ADAM
(smiles)
You want to come in?
Yeah.

KATHERINE

They walk inside.
KATHERINE
Look at you, walking up a storm.
Kyle clears his throat and waves meekly from the corner.
ADAM
You remember Kyle...
KYLE
Good to see you...I see you brought
a pizza, which is good because I
haven’t fed him all day. I just
changed the dressing on his wound.
There’s Vicodin in the bathroom if
you need it; I know people take it
recreationally but he actually
needs it for his aches-Adam stares at Kyle, blankly. Katherine looks to Adam, unsure
how to react.
KATHERINE
(dead serious)
Are there channels he can’t watch?
Katherine cracks a smile. Kyle beams.

(CONTINUED)

KYLE
(to Adam)
That’s funny.
(to Katherine)
So, you’re doing your doctorate I
hear? That’s-Adam opens the door and ushers Kyle out.
ADAM
Dude, you’re awesome.
Alright!

KYLE

Kyle moves toward the door and whispers to AdamKYLE (CONT’D)
She’s cool.
Adam smiles, and closes the door on Kyle. Adam then turns
around and looks at Katherine.
So.
So.
